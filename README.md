## Learning

1) How Scripts work within Unity. Either add as component or drag and drop script to the object.
2) How Gravity works. When I was toggling gravity on and off, it had effect on some object more prominently especially in motion.
3) There is a direction of Gravity as well
4) Positioning of the objects in x,y,z axis.
5) Camera position of the scene.
